                    <blockquote>
                    <q>I fight with an indomitable spirit, my back to the wall, defeat is for those who accept it</q> <q>The greatest strands of affection are woven in adversity. Leadership means suffering. The Leader, who has no marks, indelible marks to show either on his physical body or in his mind have never led.</q> <q>How many Socrates did Greece breed? How many Negro's did India breed? They have one each but they all had one thing in common, sense of mission. An unquenchable thirst to get things done. We need as in this instance only one courageous Nigerian to take a stand. But no Nigerian wants to offer his head to break a coconut.</q>
